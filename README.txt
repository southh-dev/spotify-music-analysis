Hi! Welcome to my Spotify Data Analysis Project.

My main notebook is a spotify user analysis that is going to analyse a bunch of my personal music habits. The goal is to analyse the difference in music listening habits in different time frames.


If you'd like to fork this project and use some of my code yourself, be sure to create a config.py file with the following formatting :

CLIENT_ID = ''
CLIENT_SECRET = ''
REDIRECT_URI = ''


This will allow the code to log you into your own account so you can review this data!
